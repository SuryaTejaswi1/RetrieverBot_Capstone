## Overview

Retriever Bot is a cutting-edge conversational AI chatbot specifically designed for UMBC Data Science students to assist with a variety of information needs, including:

- 📘 **Course-related queries**
- 🧑‍🔬 **Faculty research details**
- 💬 **General program inquiries**

The chatbot integrates Dialogflow for intent recognition and utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model for generating dynamic, context-aware responses. To enhance conversational retrieval capabilities, the application leverages LangChain and uses Chroma for efficient vector storage of embeddings.

## Research Questions

The following research questions guide the development and evaluation of Retriever Bot:

1. 🎯 **Effectiveness**: How effective is the Retriever Bot in improving access to specific information about coursework, faculty, and other program details, as measured by user satisfaction and reduced information search time?
2. 🌎 **CPT/OPT Guidance**: How can conversational AI enhance CPT and OPT registration guidance for international students, and how helpful will it be in improving user satisfaction?
3. ✅ **Accuracy**: How accurately can the chatbot respond to diverse student inquiries using up-to-date data from the UMBC Data Science website, and how well does this meet students' needs?

## Features

### Core Functionalities

- 🤖 **Intent Handling**: Custom intent mapping and management using Dialogflow for precise query understanding.
- 🔍 **Conversational Retrieval**: Utilizes LangChain and memory unit for retrieving relevant and contextually accurate information.
- 🗣️ **Feedback Mechanism**: Gathers user feedback to iteratively improve the bot’s responses.
- 🛠️ **Meta Data Filtering and Contextual Understanding**: Leverages memory for enhanced contextual responses and metadata filtering.
- 🔄 **Automated Data Scraping**: Periodic scraping and updating of embeddings ensure the chatbot stays current with the latest information.

### Deployment and Scalability

- 🐳 **Dockerized Deployment**: Ensures consistent and scalable deployment across environments.
- 🚀 **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automated builds and deployments using GitHub Actions streamline updates.

## Architecture
The following diagram illustrates the architecture of the Retriever Bot system:
![Architecture Diagram](assets/architecture.png)

### Architecture Overview

- 🤖 **Dialogflow**: Handles intent recognition, categorizing user queries into predefined intents for routing to the appropriate response pipeline.
- 🧠 **LangChain**: Manages conversational retrieval workflows, maintaining context across interactions.
- 💡 **OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo**: Generates coherent, context-aware responses tailored to user inputs.
- 📂 **Chroma**: Stores and manages embeddings for efficient retrieval of relevant data.
- 🔄 **Automated Data Scraping Pipelines**: Periodically updates the knowledge base by scraping the UMBC Data Science website.
- 🚀 **CI/CD Pipelines with GitHub Actions**: Automates the building, and deployment of the application.

## Implementation Details

- 🤖 **Dialogflow**: Includes custom intents for academic queries, administrative tasks (e.g., CPT/OPT guidance), and fallback intents for ambiguous queries.
- 🧠 **LangChain with memory**: Facilitates conversational retrieval, ensuring relevant embeddings are fetched based on query similarity.
- 📂 **Chroma**: Utilizes OpenAI's Ada 002 text embedding model for high-quality vector representations and efficient retrieval.
- 🌐 **Selenium**: Used for automated scraping of the UMBC Data Science website(dil.umbc.edu).

- 🤖 A Dialogflow Agent

## How to Get Started

### 🌐 Colab Notebooks
To make the project more accessible, we provide Jupyter Notebook files that can be run directly on Google Colab. These notebooks include step-by-step examples and allow users to test and interact with various components of the Retriever Bot, including scraping, embedding generation, and chatbot interactions.

- [Chatbot Interaction Notebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i1SXSxEjtGyuHH3garqGlijxhPrOZkU_/view?usp=sharing)

### Quick Start Guide

1. 🌀 Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/retriever-bot.git
   ```

2. 📂 Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd retriever-bot
   ```

3. 🛠️ Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. 📦 Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
